This project is focused on developing a comprehensive and versatile open-source blog platform. The platform is designed to include key functionalities such as user registration, authentication, and role-based access control, supporting various user roles like admin, user, editor, author, and reviewer.

To enhance security and user experience, the platform will feature email verification and CSRF protection. The user management system will allow administrators to manage user permissions and roles efficiently. A built-in blog editor will enable users to create and edit posts directly within the platform, including the ability to invite others for review, with reviewers able to leave comments directly in the text.

In addition to content management, the platform will include a comment system for users to engage with blog posts. It will also support content review workflows, including draft submission, review, and approval processes. This project is designed to be scalable and secure, with an emphasis on providing a user-friendly experience for all participants.

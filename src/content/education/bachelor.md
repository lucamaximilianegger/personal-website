I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in IT Security at Wilhelm Büchner Hochschule, getting hands-on with some exciting topics and also experimenting with them practically to gain personal experiences. As I progress, I'm looking forward to delving into topics such as:

- Basic and Advanced Programming (Python and Java)
- Software Engineering and Architecture
- IT Security (Network Security, Cryptography, Security Management, Penetration Testing and Security Auditing)
- Project Management and Scientific Work
